Here's my personal website! As you can see, it's pretty much self-explanatory.

# Design Notes

I should explain something here, because you're probably confused by the lack of 
any CSS or JS files in this project. This isn't entirely due to my laziness 
(although that might be part of it!). There are two reasons for this choice:

- Everything in the project description can be done with just HTML. So I 
decided to stick with that because I liked the simplicity it provided. I 
might actually make this website better and prettier in the future, 
but for now, [I'm just using HTML](https://justfuckingusehtml.com)!
- This thing is unbreakable! It works everywhere, and even a 12-year-old who 
watched the first 20 minutes of a YouTube tutorial can understand and change 
it. No one needs to support it, no one needs to deploy it, and I like this 
simplicity.
